Netflix over the past 5-10 years has acquired a large number of viewers. As the number of viewers increased, so did the variety of shows. Accordingly, analysts from the film industry were faced with the task of researching data with the ratings of various series.

In this task, we will conduct a visual analysis of the 1000 Netflix Shows dataset (as of 06/11/2017) and draw conclusions.

____

**What questions will we answer in this study:**

 * How many rating groups are present in the data
 * What ratings do users rate most often
 * What ratings do users give on average
 * What years were the shows launched
 * Can we conclude that 2017 is a better year for Netflix
 * Which rating groups are running shows on Netflix
 * We will choose the show you like and make a descriptive portrait of it
